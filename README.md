   - Aligning photonic and electronic components on a chip with nanometer precision is challenging.

3. **Integration and Miniaturization**:
   - Combining photonic components with traditional silicon-based electronics in a cost-effective manner is a major hurdle.
   - Heat dissipation and interference issues when miniaturizing these systems.

4. **Reliability and Stability**:
   - Ensuring long-term stability of new materials like perovskites under environmental stress (e.g., temperature, humidity).

5. **High Costs**:
   - Initial investments in advanced machinery and materials development are significant.
   - Low yield in production due to material and process inefficiencies.

6. **Market Adoption**:
   - Lack of standardized designs and interfaces slows industry adoption.
   - High initial costs can deter potential applications compared to existing technologies.

7. **Testing and Quality Control**:
   - Developing fast, reliable, and cost-effective methods to test phototronic devices on a large scale is still a work in progress.
